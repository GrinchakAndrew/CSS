														(1) HTML file that is not controlled by a style sheet: "unstyled content";
													</li>
													<li>
														(2) Before authors were allowed to control HTML pages through CSS, browsers had to have some way of displaying HTML content visually: browser manufacturers developed 'default style sheets' to display specific elements;

														(3) Slight differences from one browser to another;
													</li>
													<li>
														(4) When you write CSS, one of the things you're actually doing is overriding those default browser styles: If you forget about the browser's default styles, it's really easy to miss a little bit of spacing on an element, or some text formatting, that makes your design or layout either look a bit off or not work at all;
													</li>
													<li>
														(5) Typical situation: you are wasting lots of time trying to find the error in your styles, rather than looking into the default margins or styling of a specific element;
													</li>
													<li>
														(6) CSS technique designed to specifically counter this default styling, claled the 'CSS reset'.
													</li>
													<li>
														(7) The end user can overrule your styles any time they wish.
													</li>
													<li>
														(8) The 'Golden Rule' of CSS: make sure you're overriding default styles correctly: the last style is the one that will work (Ha-ha).
