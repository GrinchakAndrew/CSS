                                <li>
									(1) Parent is styled with '<b>text-align: center;</b>' 
										Child block should be styled as '<b>display: inline-block;</b>'
                                </li>
								<li>
									(2) Parent is assigned own width above zero, e.g. '<b>width: 1000px;</b>' 
										Make sure the child block does not take up all the width by default, i.e., its width is less than that of the parent. 
										The child is assigned with style: '<b>margin: 0 auto;</b>'
                                </li>
								<li>
									(3) Assign the internal child block-element '<b>position : absolute;</b>' and style '<b>left : 50%;</b>'
										However, for the whole width of the block its margin should be set to <em><b>minus half of its width</b></em>.
                                </li>
								<li>
									(4) Vertical center-alignment is possible, when an element has '<b>position: absolute;</b>' styling
									and <b>top : 50%;</b>, however, its parent should be styled with '<b>position : relative;</b>', 
									because absolute positioning will aling block relative to its first parent with relative positioning,
									or if such a block is not found, than by the first parent block to be found, e.g., <b>html</b>.
									But, if I know the height of the block, I can set it margin-top at negative half-value of its height.
									This will make the block evenly vertically-aligned.
                                </li>
								<li>
									(5) If we do not know the height and width 
									of the block, which we want to have center-aligned:
									we shoudl set it the style '<b>position: absolute;</b>' and 
									'<b>top : 50%;</b>' and '<b>left: 50%;</b>'; 
									then its parent should be styled with 
									'<b>position: relative;</b>', and afterwards, the child should have the style set: 
									'<b>transform(translate(-50%, -50%));</b>'.
                                </li>
								<li>
									(6) Line-height: style will align the block by its baseline. 
									   the block should be styled with own height and style '<b>display: inline;</b>' 
									   or '<b>display: inline-block;</b>'.
									   The block itself will make alignment by its baseline of its parent is assigned <b>line-height</b> property.
                                </li>
								<li>
									(7) Use of the 'table-cell' alingment: parent should be assigned with '<b>display: table;</b>' 
									  child should be styled with '<b>display: cell;</b>' and '<b>vertical-align: middle;</b>'.
                                </li>
								<li>
									(8) Parent should be styled with '<b>position: relative;</b>' 
										Its child should be styled with '<b>position: absolute;</b>' and 
										'<b>display: block;</b>' and 
										'<b>margin: 0 auto;</b>' and
										'<b>left: 0;</b>' and
										'<b>top: 0;</b>' and
										'<b>right: 0;</b>' and
										'<b>bottom: 0;</b>'.
                                </li>
